# How to Get More Value From Your Agent Mode Requests

Since your agent mode requests are limited, here's how to make each one count.

## Plan Before You Request

Don't jump into requests without thinking. Spend time planning:
- What exactly do you need done?
- What's the end result you want?
- Is there anything Agent Mode needs to know to do this right?

A well-planned request often works the first time. A vague request might need 2-3 tries.

## Be Specific and Complete in One Ask

Give Agent Mode all the information it needs in your request. If you leave things out, you'll need to send follow-up requests.

**Wastes requests:** "Fix this document"  
**Saves requests:** "Fix all spelling and grammar errors in this document, then create a summary at the top with the main points"

## Ask for Multiple Things in One Request

If you have related tasks, ask for them together. Agent Mode can often handle several things at once.

**This uses one request:**  
"Organize this list of names alphabetically, remove any duplicates, and make sure each name is formatted consistently with First Last name format."

## Combine Related Tasks

Instead of asking for one thing at a time, think about what needs to happen and ask for everything in that sequence.

**Multiple requests (wastes quota):**
1. "Find all errors"
2. "Fix the errors"
3. "Format it"

**One smart request (saves quota):**
"Find all errors in this document and fix them, then format it with consistent spacing and alignment."

## Review the Result Carefully

Before you accept Agent Mode's work, check it thoroughly. A good review now saves you from wasting requests on corrections later.

## Use Smart Follow-Ups

If Agent Mode doesn't get it quite right, be specific about what to fix instead of starting over.

**Wastes a request:** Send a completely new request with different wording  
**Saves a request:** "Almost perfect, but also remove the blank lines between sections"

## Know What's Worth a Request

Focus your requests on things that:
- Save you real time (organizing large lists, finding information)
- Are repetitive and need consistency
- Require reviewing a lot of information
- Are important but tedious

Don't use requests on quick tasks you can do faster yourself.

## Ask It to Double-Check

Instead of sending multiple requests to verify work, ask Agent Mode to review its own work in the same request.

**Good approach:**  
"Find all the product IDs in this list, then count them and tell me if you found at least 50."

## Avoid Back-and-Forth

The more you go back and forth with requests, the more quota you use. Try to get it right in 1-2 requests by being clear upfront.

## Bundle Similar Tasks

If you have multiple documents or lists that need the same treatment, ask Agent Mode to do them all at once.

**Example:**  
"I have 3 customer lists. For each one, remove duplicates and sort alphabetically. Here are all 3 lists..."

## Think About the Real Cost

Each request counts against your limit. Before you send one, ask: "Is this worth using one of my limited requests?" If the answer is no, do it yourself or wait to combine it with another task.
